Design an IoT platform using AWS Lambda with Python for managing smart home devices connected via MQTT protocol. Implement a NoSQL database using AWS DynamoDB to store device states and history logs. The system must include an Admin dashboard built with Vue.js, allowing remote configuration and update of device firmware. Integration endpoints with Alexa and Google Assistant should be provided using AWS API Gateway. Implement a user authentication mechanism using Cognito for device access. A data processing pipeline using AWS Kinesis should handle streaming device data into a Redshift data warehouse for analytics. Network configurations, including security groups and IAM roles, should be detailed. Provide code using the specified formatting and ensure all functionality can be deployed with minimal setup.
