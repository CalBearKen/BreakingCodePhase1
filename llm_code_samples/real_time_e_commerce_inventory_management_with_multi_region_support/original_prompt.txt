Develop a comprehensive e-commerce platform focused on inventory management with real-time updates. Use Node.js for backend services (version 16), React for frontend (version 17), and MongoDB as the NoSQL database. The system should integrate payment processing via Stripe and handle inventory updates across multiple geographical regions with AWS DynamoDB Streams for real-time synchronization. Implement OAuth 2.0 for user authentication and incorporate a GraphQL API to enable flexible querying from the frontend. Data pipelines with Apache Kafka should manage product update events, flowing into an Elasticsearch cluster for search capabilities. Deploy microservices using Kubernetes with Helm charts on AWS EKS, ensuring auto-scaling and load balancing, and set up monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana dashboards. Essential code structure requirements: ```language with specified filename and comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase.
