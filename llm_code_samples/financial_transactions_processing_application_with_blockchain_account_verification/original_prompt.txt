Create a financial transactions processing application using Java Spring Boot (version 2.6) with a PostgreSQL database to log transaction details. Implement integration with external banksâ€™ APIs using secure OAuth 2.0 flows and verify transactions using a private Ethereum blockchain smart contract for account validation. Manage user authentication and permissions using custom JWT tokens and incorporate Kafka for reliable transaction event streaming. Use Redis for caching real-time transactions and ensure microservices are containerized and orchestrated with Docker and Kubernetes on Azure AKS. Provide detailed error handling, comprehensive API documentation generated with Swagger, and maintain compliance with financial transaction auditing requirements via detailed logging using ELK stack. Code must include examples of all transaction states and blockchain interaction code configured in executable files.
