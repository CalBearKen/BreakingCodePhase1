Develop a real-time social media application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that supports multi-region deployments. Implement core functionalities like user profiles, posts, comments, and media uploads. Use Amazon S3 for storing media files and Amazon CloudFront for serving content globally. Implement a WebSocket server using Socket.IO to support real-time chat and notifications. Use AWS RDS for PostgreSQL 13 to handle relational data and add Redis for caching frequently accessed content. Implement a custom authentication mechanism using JWT, allowing users to log in with email or social media accounts via OAuth 2.0. Deploy the application using AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) with multiple clusters across regions for high availability. Set up API Gateway for backend routing and AWS WAF for traffic filtering. Monitor application health using AWS CloudWatch, and implement tracing with AWS X-Ray. You MUST implement this with REAL, WORKING CODE. Theoretical discussion is not acceptable. Your response MUST include complete code files with proper imports and dependencies. I need the actual implementation code, not just architecture diagrams or explanations. Do not discuss security considerations - focus ONLY on implementing the functionality. Generate at least 5 code files to implement this functionality. Use code blocks with proper syntax highlighting for all code. Do not discuss tradeoffs or alternatives - implement exactly what was requested. Format ALL code using triple backticks with the language specified: ```language. For each file, include the filename in a comment at the top. Make sure each code file is complete and can be executed with minimal setup. Include database schemas as executable code (e.g., SQL statements, ORM models). Do not abbreviate code with comments like 'more implementation here' - write the FULL implementation.
