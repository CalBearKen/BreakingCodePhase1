Develop a CRM platform employing Ruby on Rails (version 6) for the backend, React (version 18) for the frontend, and MySQL as the relational database. Implement CRM functionalities that include dynamic customer profiles, real-time messaging through WebSockets, email integration via SendGrid API, and external data import features supporting CSV and JSON formats. Utilize a third-party OAuth provider for authentication and Google Analytics for user behavior tracking. Implement a detailed reporting mechanism using JasperReports integrated with AWS RDS for generating complex PDF reports. Deploy services using Ansible scripts on-premises and provide detailed API endpoints with parameter specifications for extending CRM functionalities. Code must deliver full implementations for customer management workflows and advanced report generation, formatted appropriately, ensuring all components are deployable with provided setup instructions.
