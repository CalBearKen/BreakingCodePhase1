Integrate with the Stripe API for payment processing. Implement a recommendation engine using Python 3.8 and TensorFlow 2.x for generating personalized product suggestions based on user behavior. Backend should expose a RESTful API with endpoints for products, users, and orders. Use PostgreSQL 13 for the database, with a detailed schema including users, products, orders, and recommendations tables. Include JWT-based authentication with custom token generation and expiration logic. Implement caching using Redis 6 for user sessions and product data. Deploy the application using AWS ECS with Fargate, using Terraform for infrastructure as code. Ensure logging with Amazon CloudWatch and monitoring with AWS CloudWatch Alarms. You MUST implement this with REAL, WORKING CODE. Theoretical discussion is not acceptable. Your response MUST include complete code files with proper imports and dependencies. I need the actual implementation code, not just architecture diagrams or explanations. Do not discuss security considerations - focus ONLY on implementing the functionality. Generate at least 5 code files to implement this functionality. Use code blocks with proper syntax highlighting for all code. Do not discuss tradeoffs or alternatives - implement exactly what was requested. Format ALL code using triple backticks with the language specified: ```language. For each file, include the filename in a comment at the top. Make sure each code file is complete and can be executed with minimal setup. Include database schemas as executable code (e.g., SQL statements, ORM models). Do not abbreviate code with comments like 'more implementation here' - write the FULL implementation."
